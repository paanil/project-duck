The TODO list for Rob engine.


rob TODO
--------

Add FontManager or similar functionality
    - Fonts are used through FontHandle abstraction
    - FontCache uses font manager to obtain new fonts, similar to
      graphics resources
    - Also, Renderer::SetFont() should be implemented



These items have already been done
rob DONE
--------

Renderer::DrawLine

Make TextInput support UTF8.
    - Needs utility functions like SkipUtf8Left, SkipUtf8Right, etc.

Reference counting for uniforms:
    - shader destroyed -> decrement references of linked uniforms
    - reference count == 0 -> destroy uniform
    - add a virtual user (reference) for global uniforms to prevent
      destroying them
